This is a very nice task, we can see that a lot of work was put into it! Really a nice new innovative take on the typical reinforcement learning task. I know I did not perform well, I was rather focusing on my impression of the visuals and just the experience rather than learning the probabilities. 
I would have the few comments:
1. The whole space theme is very well done, the background is amazing. Yet, I found it a bit problematic with some of the colours of the asteroids (especially the blueish and purpleish one, the bright green, yellow and reddish one worked great and where easy to distinguish versus the background). Also depending on how these asteroids are paired,  it can make learning a bit confusing if the colors are too similar (however I imagine this would vary between monitors and brightness levels) 
2. Really nice to have the sound, made the task more engaging for me, but maybe some people would find it distracting (?)
3. In the instructions at the start I would add that you can move the ship in ALL four directions, not just sideways (+ need to click on START to actually begin) + say that if you miss hitting an asteroid you get minus points + only one hit is needed to destroy the asteroid + Also an approximate duration of the task would be appreciated (e.g, approx. 10-15minutes or something).
4. The spaceship really responded well and also it is easy to aim at the asteroids (so the proportions of the stimuli is good in my opinion), for that I would also recommend to state to have the game in full screen
5. The pace is just right, maybe for older adults it might be too quick (?), but I'd reckon for the average young adult is good and not too slow or fast.
6. The display of the score in the corner is clear, and not too distracting. 

Really cool stuff!","2021-06-08"

Sometimes I was slow on pairs that I knew perfectly well, just because they hadn't appeared in a while and I had to remind myself, so distance (in time) to last appearance will probably influence RTs.

I wondered, since you have several pairs, why are the pairs fixed during the transfer phase ?

Also, where is the Imperial fleet ??! Do you think I'm just a space farmer ?!
